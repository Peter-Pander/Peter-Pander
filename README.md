# Hey, I'm Max 👋

I'm a web developer 💻 with a love for frontend design and all things interactive.  
I started in law ⚖️ but found my passion in coding 💡. There’s nothing like seeing a product you built come to life!

I’m especially drawn to **cyberpunk aesthetics** and love bringing ideas to life through interactive, user-friendly apps.  
Whether I'm working with **React** or **Stimulus**, I enjoy crafting frontends that feel smooth and intuitive.

I also have a strong connection to Japan 🇯🇵 — I studied in Osaka, worked in Tokyo, and passed the **JLPT N2**.

🚀 Always up for new projects, discussions, or exchanging ideas. Let’s connect! 🤝
