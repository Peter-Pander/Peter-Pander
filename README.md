# Hey, I'm Max 👋  

I'm a **Web Developer**, **Frontend Enthusiast**, and **Aspiring Game Dev**.
I started in law but found my passion in coding. There’s nothing like seeing a product you built come to life! Currently, I’m working on **LairBnB**, a fantasy rental platform, and expanding my skills by diving into **Unity** to explore game development.

I’m especially drawn to **cyberpunk aesthetics** and love creating stylish, user-friendly apps. 
I also have a strong connection to **Japan**—I studied in Osaka for a year, worked in Tokyo for six months, and hold **JLPT N2**.

### 💻 Tech I’m working with:
- Ruby on Rails
- JavaScript & Stimulus
- PostgreSQL
- SCSS & Bootstrap

🚀 Always up for new projects, discussions, or exchanging ideas. Let’s connect!
