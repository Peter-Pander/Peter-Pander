# Hey, I'm Max 👋  

I'm a **Web Developer** and **Frontend Enthusiast**.  
I started in law but found my passion in coding. There’s nothing like seeing a product you built come to life!  

I’m especially drawn to **cyberpunk aesthetics** and love bringing ideas to life through interactive, user-friendly apps. Whether I'm working with **React** or **Stimulus**, I enjoy crafting frontends that feel smooth and intuitive.

I also have a strong connection to **Japan** — I studied in Osaka for a year, worked in Tokyo for six months, and hold **JLPT N2**.
